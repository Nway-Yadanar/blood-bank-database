# 🩸 Blood Bank Management Database System
This is a small database project developed for **Level 5 Diploma in Computing (NCC)coursework 2024** . The project uses **Microsoft SQL Server** and includes basic tasks like database creation, data insertion, and running queries. Mainly designed to streamline blood donor records, blood inventory, and hospital needs. It was created with the aim to improve efficiency and reliability in blood availability, especially in regions where healthcare resources are limited.



Files Include:
`Bloodbankdb.mdf`              | Main database file (Microsoft SQL Server)        |
| `Bloodbankdb_log.ldf`          | Database log file                                |
| `SQLQuery1_Create_Task5.sql`  | SQL script to create database tables (Task 5)    |
| `SQLQuery2_Insert_Task6.sql`  | SQL script to insert data (Task 6)               |
| `SQLQuery3_Queries_Task7.sql` | SQL script to perform queries (Task 7)        


📌 Notes

- This project does **not** include a front-end interface.
- It is a purely backend database project for learning and academic demonstration.

## 💡 Purpose
Access to blood can be a life-or-death matter, especially during emergencies. This system helps:
- Store and retrieve donor data efficiently
- Track available blood types
- Match hospitals with donors faster

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- MySQL / SQL
- Database design principles
- ERD and schema creation

## 🔍 Features
- Donor registration and blood type tracking
- Hospital request management
- Searchable database for available blood types

## 🌏 Impact
Although originally built as a student project, the system reflects a deeper commitment to improving access to lifesaving resources using technology. It can be adapted for small clinics, NGOs, or future app development.
